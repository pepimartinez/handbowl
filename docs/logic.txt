//Logic
	//Handbowl
		# Get fb and hs products
		# Compare them and find all products that are missing in hs
		# Add those products as new ones to hs
		# For each fishbowl sku find hs sku and update price and inventory

		# Get fb and hs customers
		# If fishbowl is missing hs customer then make a customer csv import

		# If order has not been exported yet then make csv for importing


	//Fishbowl ~ = /handbowl/handbowl

			# export customers to ~/data/customer/out
			# export products to ~/data/products/out
			
			#import customers from ~/data/customers/in
